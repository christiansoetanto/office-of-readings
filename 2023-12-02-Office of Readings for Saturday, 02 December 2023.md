**From a sermon by Saint Augustine, bishop**

(Sermo 256, 1.3.4; PL 38, 1191-1193)

_Let us sing alleluia to the good God who delivers us from evil_

Let us sing alleluia here on earth, while we still live in anxiety, so that we may sing it one day in heaven in full security. Why do we now live in anxiety? Can you expect me not to feel anxious when I read: _Is not man’s life on earth a time of trial?_ Can you expect me not to feel anxious when the words still ring in my ears: _Watch and pray that you will not be put to the test?_ Can you expect me not to feel anxious when there are so many temptations here below that prayer itself reminds us of them, when we say: _Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us?_ Every day we make our petitions, every day we sin. Do you want me to feel secure when I am daily asking pardon for my sins, and requesting help in time of trial? Because of my past sins I pray: _Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,_ and then, because of the perils still before me, I immediately go on to add: _Lead us not into temptation_. How can all be well with people who are crying out with me: _Deliver us from evil?_ And yet, brothers, while we are still in the midst of this evil, let us sing alleluia to the good God who delivers us from evil.

Even here amidst trials and temptations let us, let all men, sing alleluia. _God is faithful,_ says holy Scripture, _and he will not allow you to be tried beyond your strength._ So let us sing alleluia, even here on earth. Man is still a debtor, but God is faithful. Scripture does not say that he will not allow you to be tried, but that _he will not allow you to be tried beyond your strength. Whatever the trial, he will see you through it safely, and so enable you to endure._ You have entered upon a time of trial but you will come to no harm—God’s help will bring you through it safely. You are like a piece of pottery, shaped by instruction, fired by tribulation. When you are put into the oven therefore, keep your thoughts on the time when you will be taken out again; for God is faithful, and _he will guard both your going in and your coming out._

But in the next life, when this body of ours has become immortal and incorruptible, then all trials will be over. _Your body is indeed dead, and why? Because of sin._ Nevertheless, _your spirit lives, because you have been justified._ Are we to leave our dead bodies behind then? By no means. Listen to the words of holy Scripture: _If the Spirit of him who raised Christ from the dead dwells within you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your own mortal bodies._ At present your body receives its life from the soul, but then it will receive it from the Spirit.

O the happiness of the heavenly alleluia, sung in security, in fear of no adversity! We shall have no enemies in heaven, we shall never lose a friend. God’s praises are sung both there and here, but here they are sung by those destined to die, there, by those destined to live for ever; here they are sung in hope, there, in hope’s fulfillment; here they are sung by wayfarers, there, by those living in their own country.

So, then, my brothers, let us sing now, not in order to enjoy a life of leisure, but in order to lighten our labors. You should sing as wayfarers do—sing, but continue your journey. Do not be lazy, but sing to make your journey more enjoyable. Sing, but keep going. What do I mean by keep going? Keep on making progress. This progress, however, must be in virtue; for there are some, the Apostle warns, whose only progress is in vice. If you make progress, you will be continuing your journey, but be sure that your progress is in virtue, true faith and right living. Sing then, but keep going.
