**From a commentary on Ecclesiastes by Saint Gregory of Agrigentum, bishop**

(Lib 10,2: PG 98, 1138-1139)

_Approach the Lord and receive his light_

In the words of Ecclesiastes: _Light itself is delightful,_ and it is a great boon for the eye to have sight of the sun. Devoid of light, the world would be without beauty and life would be lifeless. That was why Moses, who saw God, said in anticipation: _And God saw the light and said that it was good._ To reflect on the true and eternal light is even more fitting for us. This light is Christ who _enlightens every man who comes into the world,_ the savior and redeemer of the world. He is the one who became man and sank to the very depths of the human condition. As David said: _Sing to God a hymn to his name, make a highway for him who rises to the west. His name is the Lord, rejoice before him!_

This light he called delightful and foretold that it would be good to see the sun of glory. In the days of his incarnation, he said: _I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness but will possess the light of life._ On another occasion he said: _This is the judgment: the light has come into the world._

Sunlight, then, is a symbol. What we see with our eyes foretells the coming of the Sun of Justice. He was a most delightful light for those who were worthy to be instructed by him personally. He was also a radiance to those who saw him with their bodily eyes when he lived on earth as a man among men. It was not just any man they saw, for he was true God. He made the blind see, the lame walk, and the deaf hear. He cleansed the lepers, and by a simple command he raised the dead back to life.

Now it is our supreme delight to behold him and contemplate his divine splendor with the eyes of our spirit. When we participate in and associate with that beauty, we are enlightened and adorned and this is our delight. We take delight in being saturated with the sweetness of the Spirit, in being clothed in holiness, in achieving wisdom. Finally we are filled with a joy that comes from God and endures through all the days of our earthly life. In the wise words of Ecclesiastes: _A man may live for many years, but he will experience happiness throughout his days._ For all who gaze upon the Sun of Justice, he is their supreme delight. David spoke of them: _Let them be joyful before God and be jubilant with joy._ Indeed he even said: _Rejoice in the Lord, you who are just, for praise befits those who are upright._
