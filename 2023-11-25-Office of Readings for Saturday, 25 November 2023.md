(Coll. super Credo in Deum: Opuscula theologica 2, Taurini 1954, pp. 216-7)

_I shall be satisfied when your glory is seen_

It is fitting that the end of all our desires, namely eternal life, coincides with the words at the end of the creed, “Life everlasting. Amen.”

The first point about eternal life is that man is united with God. For God himself is the reward and end of all our labors. _I am your protector and your supreme reward._ This union consists in seeing perfectly: _At present we are looking at a confused reflection in a mirror, but then we shall see face to face._

Next it consists in perfect praise, according to the words of the prophet: _Joy and happiness will be found in it, thanksgiving and words of praise._

It also consists in the complete satisfaction of desire, for there the blessed will be given more than they wanted or hoped for. The reason is that in this life no one can fulfill his longing, nor can any creature satisfy man’s desire. Only God satisfies, he infinitely exceeds all other pleasures. That is why man can rest in nothing but God. As Augustine says: _You have made us for yourself, Lord, and our heart can find no rest until it rests in you._

Since in their heavenly home the saints will possess God completely, obviously their longing will be satisfied, and their glory will be even greater. That is why the Lord says: _Enter in the joy of your Lord._ Augustine adds: _The fullness of joy will not enter into those who rejoice, but those who rejoice will enter into joy. I shall be satisfied when your glory is seen,_ and again: _He who satisfies your desire with good things._

Whatever is delightful is there in superabundance. If delights are sought, there is supreme and most perfect delight. It is said of God, the supreme good: _Boundless delights are in your right hand._

Again, eternal life consists of the joyous community of all the blessed, a community of supreme delight, since everyone will share all that is good with all the blessed. Everyone will love everyone else as himself, and therefore will rejoice in another’s good as in his own. So it follows that the happiness and joy of each grows in proportion to the joy of all.
