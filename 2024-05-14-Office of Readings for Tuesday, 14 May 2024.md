**From a homily on the Acts of the Apostles by Saint John Chrysostom, bishop**

(Hom. 3, 1, 2, 3,: PG 60, 33-36, 38)

_Make known to us Lord, the one you choose_

_In those days, Peter, stood up in the midst of the disciples and said_… As the fiery spirit to whom the flock was entrusted by Christ and as the leader in the band of the apostles, Peter always took the initiative in speaking: _My brothers, we must choose from among our number._ He left the decision to the whole body, at once augmenting the honor of those elected and avoiding any suspicion of partiality. For such great occasions can easily lead to trouble.

Did not Peter then have the right to make the choice himself ? Certainly he had the right, but he did not want to give the appearance of showing special favor to anyone. Besides he was not yet endowed with the Spirit. _And they nominated two,_ we read _, Joseph, who was called Barsabbas and surnamed Justus, and Matthias._ He himself did not nominate them; all present did. But it was he who brought the issue forward, pointing out that it was not his own idea but had been suggested to him by a scriptural prophecy. So he was speaking not as a teacher but as an interpreter.

_So,_ he goes on, _we must choose from those men who lived in our company._ Notice how insistent he is that they should be eyewitnesses. Even though the Spirit would come to ratify the choice, Peter regards this prior qualification as most important.

_Those who lived in our company,_ to continue the passage, _all through the time when the Lord Jesus came and went among us._ He refers to those who had dwelt with Jesus, not just those who had been his disciples. For of course from the very beginning many had followed him. Notice how it is written that Peter himself was _one of the two who had listened to John, and followed Jesus._

_All through the time when the Lord Jesus came and went among us,_ to continue further, _beginning with the baptism of John_ _—_ rightly so, because no one knew what had happened before that time, although they were to know of it later through the Spirit.

_Up to the day,_ Peter added, _on which he was taken up from us—one of these must be made a witness along with us of his resurrection._ He did not say “a witness of the rest of his actions” but only _a witness of the resurrection!_ That witness would be more believable who could declare that he who ate and drank and was crucified also rose from the dead. He needed to be a witness not of the times before or after that event, and not of the signs and wonders, but only of the resurrection itself. For the rest happened by general admission, openly; but the resurrection took place secretly, and was known to these men only.

And they all prayed together, saying: _You, Lord, know the hearts of men; make your choice known to us. You,_ not _we_. Appropriately they said that he knew the hearts of men, because the choice was to be made by him, not by others.

They spoke with such confidence, because someone had to be appointed. They did not say “choose” but _make known to us_ the chosen one; _the one you choose,_ they said, fully aware that everything was preordained by God. _They then drew lots._ For they did not think themselves worthy to make the choice of their own accord, and therefore they wanted some sign for their instruction.
