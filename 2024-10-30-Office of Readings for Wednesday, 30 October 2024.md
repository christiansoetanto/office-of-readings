**From a letter to the Corinthians by Saint Clement I, pope and martyr**

(Cap. 30, 3-4:34, 2—35, 5: Funk 1, 99, 103-105)

_Let us follow the way of truth_

Let us put on the unity of mind, thinking humble thoughts, exercising self-control, keeping ourselves far from all backbiting and slander, being righteous in deed, and not in word only. Scripture says: _He who says much hears much in his own turn. Or does the easy talker think that he is righteous?_

It is our duty then to be eager to do good, for everything is from God. He warns us: _See, the Lord is coming, and the reward he brings is before him, for paying each according to his work._ He urges us, who believe in him with all our heart, not to be idle or careless in any good work. Our boasting and our confidence must rest on him. Let us be subject to his will. Let us look carefully at the whole host of his angels; they stand ready and serve his will. Scripture says: _Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him, and a thousand thousand served him, and cried out: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole creation is full of his glory._

We, too, dutifully gathered together in unity of mind, should cry out to him continuously as with one voice so as to share in his great and glorious promises. It is written: _Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, man’s heart has not conceived, what great things have been prepared for those who wait for him._

Beloved, how blessed, how wonderful, are God’s gifts! Life with immortality, glory with righteousness, truth with confidence, self-control with holiness: all these are the gifts that fall within our understanding. What then are those gifts that are in store for those who wait for him? Only the most holy Creator and Father of the ages knows their greatness and their splendor.

We should then strive with the greatest zeal to be found among the number of those who await him, so that we may share in the promised gifts. How will this be, beloved? If our mind is fixed on God through faith, if we are diligent in seeking what is pleasing and acceptable to him, if we fulfill what is according to his blameless will and follow the way of truth, casting away from ourselves all that is unholy.
