**From the book of the prophet Ezekiel**

36:16-28

_I shall pour clean water upon you, and I shall give you a new heart_

Thus the word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it by their conduct and deeds. Therefore I poured out my fury upon them (because of the blood which they poured out on the ground, and because they defiled it with idols). I scattered them among the nations, dispersing them over foreign lands; according to their conduct and deeds I judged them. But when they came among the nations (wherever they came), they served to profane my holy name, because it was said of them: “These are the people of the Lord, yet they had to leave their land.” So I have relented because of my holy name which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they came.

Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Not for your sakes do I act, house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which you profaned among the nations to which you came. I will prove the holiness of my great name, profaned among the nations, in whose midst you have profaned it. Thus the nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when in their sight I prove my holiness through you.

For I will take you away from among the nations, gather you from all the foreign lands, and bring you back to your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse you from all your impurities, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.

I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you, taking from your bodies your stony hearts and giving you natural hearts. I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes, careful to observe my decrees. You shall live in the land I gave your fathers; you shall be my people, and I will be your God.

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

Psalm 42:2-3, 5bcd; 43:3-4

Like the deer that yearns

   for running streams,

so my soul is yearning

   for you, my God.

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

My soul is thirsting for God,

   the God of my life;

when can I enter and see

   the face of God?

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

These things will I remember

   as I pour out my soul:

how I would lead the rejoicing crowd

   into the house of God,

amid cries of gladness and thanksgiving,

   the throng wild with joy.

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

O send forth your light and your truth;

   let these be my guide.

Let them bring me to your holy mountain

   to the place where you dwell.

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

And I will come to the altar of God,

   the God of my joy.

My redeemer, I will thank you on the harp,

   O God, my God.

Ant. Like a deer that longs for running streams, my soul longs for you, my God.

PRAYER

_Let us pray._

God of unchanging power and light,

look with mercy and favor on your entire Church.

Bring lasting salvation to mankind,

so that the world may see

the fallen lifted up,

the old made new,

and all things brought to perfection,

through him who is their origin,

our Lord Jesus Christ,

who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

℟. Amen.

**From the letter of the apostle Paul to the Romans**

6:3-11

_Christ is raised from the dead and will never die again_

Are you not aware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Through baptism into his death we were buried with him, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live a new life.

If we have been united with him through likeness to his death, so shall we be through a like resurrection. This we know: our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed and we might be slaves to sin no longer. A man who is dead has been freed from sin.

If we have died with Christ, we believe that we are also to live with him. We know that Christ, once raised from the dead, will never die again; death has no more power over him. His death was death to sin, once for all; his life is life for God. In the same way, you must consider yourselves dead to sin but alive for God in Christ Jesus.

Ant. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Psalm 118:1-2, 16ab-17, 22-23

Give thanks to the Lord for he is good,

   for his love endures for ever.

Let the sons of Israel say:

   His love endures for ever.

Ant. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

The Lord’s right hand has triumphed;

   his right hand raised me.

I shall not die, I shall live

   and recount his deeds.

Ant. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

The stone which the builders rejected

   has become the corner stone.

This is the work of the Lord,

   a marvel in our eyes.

Ant. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

**From the holy gospel according to Mark**

16:1-7

_Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified, has been raised_

When the sabbath was over,

Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome

   bought spices so that they might go and anoint him.

Very early when the sun had risen,

   on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb.

They were saying to one another,

   “Who will roll back the stone for us

   from the entrance to the tomb?”

When they looked up,

   they saw that the stone had been rolled back;

   it was very large.

On entering the tomb they saw a young man

   sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe,

   and they were utterly amazed.

He said to them, “Do not be amazed!

You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified.

He has been raised; he is not here.

Behold the place where they laid him.

But go and tell his disciples and Peter,

   ‘He is going before you to Galilee;

   there you will see him, as he told you.’”

   and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.

You, Christ, are the king of glory,

the eternal Son of the Father.

When you became man to set us free

you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.

You overcame the sting of death,

and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.

You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.

We believe that you will come, and be our judge.

Come then, Lord, and help your people,

bought with the price of your own blood,

and bring us with your saints

to glory everlasting.
