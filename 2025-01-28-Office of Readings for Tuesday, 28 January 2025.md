**From a conference by Saint Thomas Aquinas, priest**

(Collatio 6 super Credo in Deum)

_The cross exemplifies every virtue_

Why did the Son of God have to suffer for us? There was a great need, and it can be considered in a twofold way: in the first place, as a remedy for sin, and secondly, as an example of how to act.

It is a remedy, for, in the face of all the evils which we incur on account of our sins, we have found relief through the passion of Christ. Yet, it is no less an example, for the passion of Christ completely suffices to fashion our lives. Whoever wishes to live perfectly should do nothing but disdain what Christ disdained on the cross and desire what he desired, for the cross exemplifies every virtue.

If you seek the example of love: _Greater love than this no man has, than to lay down his life for his friends._ Such a man was Christ on the cross. And if he gave his life for us, then it should not be difficult to bear whatever hardships arise for his sake.

If you seek patience, you will find no better example than the cross. Great patience occurs in two ways: either when one patiently suffers much, or when one suffers things which one is able to avoid and yet does not avoid. Christ endured much on the cross, and did so patiently, _because when he suffered he did not threaten; he was led like a sheep to the slaughter and he did not open his mouth._ Therefore Christâ€™s patience on the cross was great. _In patience let us run for the prize set before us, looking upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith who, for the joy set before him, bore his cross and despised the shame._

If you seek an example of humility, look upon the crucified one, for God wished to be judged by Pontius Pilate and to die.

If you seek an example of obedience, follow him who became obedient to the Father even unto death. _For just as by the disobedience of one man, namely, Adam, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one man, many were made righteous._

If you seek an example of despising earthly things, follow him who is the _King of kings and the Lord of lords, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge._ Upon the cross he was stripped, mocked, spat upon, struck, crowned with thorns, and given only vinegar and gall to drink.

Do not be attached, therefore, to clothing and riches, because _they divided my garments among themselves._ Nor to honors, for he experienced harsh words and scourgings. Nor to greatness of rank, _for weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on my head._ Nor to anything delightful, for _in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink._
