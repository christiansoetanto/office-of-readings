**From the Confessions of Saint Augustine, bishop**

(Lib 10, 1, 1-2, 2; 5,7 CSEL 33, 226-227, 230-231)

_Whoever I may be, Lord, I lie exposed to your scrutiny_

Lord, you know me. Let me know you. Let me come to know you _even as I am known._ You are the strength of my soul; enter it and make it a place suitable for your dwelling, a possession _without spot or blemish._ This is my hope and the reason I speak. In this hope I rejoice, when I rejoice rightly. As for the other things of this life, the less they deserve tears, the more likely will they be lamented; and the more they deserve tears, the less likely will men sorrow for them. _For behold, you have loved the truth, because the one who does what is true enters into the light._ I wish to do this truth before you alone by praising you, and before a multitude of witnesses by writing of you.

O Lord, the depths of a man’s conscience lie exposed before your eyes. Could anything remain hidden in me, even though I did not want to confess it to you? In that case I would only be hiding you from myself, not myself from you. But now my sighs are sufficient evidence that I am displeased with myself; that you are my light and the source of my joy; that you are loved and desired. I am thoroughly ashamed of myself; I have renounced myself and chosen you, recognizing that I can please neither you nor myself unless you enable me to do so.

Whoever I may be, Lord, I lie exposed to your scrutiny. I have already told of the profit I gain when I confess to you. And I do not make my confession with bodily words, bodily speech, but with the words of my soul and the cry of my mind which you hear and understand. When I am wicked, my confession to you is an expression of displeasure with myself. But when I do good, it consists in not attributing this goodness to myself. _For you, O Lord, bless the just man,_ but first _you justify the wicked._ And so I make my confession before you in silence, and yet not in silence. My voice is silent but my heart cries out.

You, O Lord, are my judge. _For though no one knows a man’s innermost self except the man’s own spirit within him,_ yet there is something in a man which even his own spirit does not know. But you know all of him, for you have made him. As for me, I despise myself in your sight, knowing that I am but dust and ashes; yet I know something of you that I do not know of myself.

True, _we see now indistinctly as in a mirror, but not yet face to face._ Therefore, so long as I am in exile from you, I am more present to myself than to you. Yet I do know that you cannot be overcome, while I am uncertain which temptations I can resist and which I cannot. Nevertheless, I have hope, because _you are faithful and do not allow us to be tempted beyond our endurance, but along with the temptation you give us the means to withstand it._

I will confess, therefore, what I know of myself, and also what I do not know. The knowledge that I have of myself, I possess because you have enlightened me; while the knowledge of myself that I do not yet possess will not be mine until my darkness shall be made as the noonday sun before your face.
