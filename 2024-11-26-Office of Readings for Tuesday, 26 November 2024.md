**From a treatise on John by Saint Augustine, bishop**

(Tract 35:8-9: CCL 36, 321-323)

_To the source you will come, the light itself you will see_

We Christians are the light, at least by comparison with unbelievers. Thus the Apostle says: _For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk then as sons of the light._ And elsewhere he says: _The night is far spent, the day is drawing near. Let us therefore lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us walk uprightly as in the day._

Nevertheless, since the days in which we are now living are still dark compared to the light which we shall see, hear what the apostle Peter says. He speaks of a voice that came from the Supreme Glory and said to the Lord Christ: _You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. This voice,_ he says, _we heard coming from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain._ Because we ourselves were not present there and did not hear the voice from heaven, Peter says to us: _And we possess a more certain prophetic word to which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts._

When, therefore, our Lord Jesus Christ shall come and, as the apostle says, _bring to light things hidden in darkness and make plain the secrets of the heart, so that everyone may receive his commendation from God,_ then lamps will no longer be needed. When that day is at hand, the prophet will not be read to us, the book of the Apostle will not be opened, we shall not require the testimony of John, we shall have no need of the Gospel itself. Therefore all Scriptures will be taken away from us, those Scriptures which in the night of this world burned like lamps so that we might not remain in darkness.

When all these things are removed as no longer necessary for our illumination, and when the men of God by whom they were ministered to us shall themselves together with us behold the true and dear light without such aids, what shall we see? With what shall our minds be nourished? What will give joy to our gaze? Where will that gladness come from _which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, which has not even been conceived by the heart of man?_ What shall we see?

I implore you to live with me and, by believing, to run with me; let us long for our heavenly country, let us sigh for our heavenly home, let us truly feel that here we are strangers. What shall we then see? Let the gospel tell us: _In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God._ You will come to the fountain, with whose dew you have already been sprinkled. Instead of the ray of light which was sent through slanting and winding ways into the heart of your darkness, you will see the light itself in all its purity and brightness. It is to see and experience this light that you are now being cleansed. _Dearly beloved,_ John himself says, _we are the sons of God, and it has not yet been disclosed what we shall be; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is._

I feel that your spirits are being raised up with mine to the heavens above; but the _body which is corruptible weighs down the soul, and this earthly tent burdens the thoughtful mind._ I am about to lay aside this book, and you are soon going away, each to his own business. It has been good for us to share the common light, good to have enjoyed ourselves, good to have been glad together. When we part from one another, let us not depart from him.
